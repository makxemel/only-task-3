Data collected includes (some items depends on versions and settings):\n\n   * The GLOBAL VARIABLES\n   * Several sys schema views including metrics or equivalent (depending on version and settings)\n   * Queries in the 95th percentile\n   * Several ndbinfo views for MySQL Cluster\n   * Replication (both master and slave) information.\n\nSome of the sys schema views are calculated as initial (optional), overall, delta:\n\n   * The initial view is the content of the view at the start of this procedure.\n     This output will be the same as the the start values used for the delta view.\n     The initial view is included if @sys.diagnostics.include_raw = ''ON''.\n   * The overall view is the content of the view at the end of this procedure.\n     This output is the same as the end values used for the delta view.\n     The overall view is always included.\n   * The delta view is the difference from the beginning to the end. Note that for min and max values\n     they are simply the min or max value from the end view respectively, so does not necessarily reflect\n     the minimum/maximum value in the monitored period.\n     Note: except for the metrics views the delta is only calculation between the first and last outputs.\n\nRequires the SUPER privilege for "SET sql_log_bin = 0;".\n\nParameters\n-----------\n\nin_max_runtime (INT UNSIGNED):\n  The maximum time to keep collecting data.\n  Use NULL to get the default which is 60 seconds, otherwise enter a value greater than 0.\nin_interval (INT UNSIGNED):\n  How long to sleep between data collections.\n  Use NULL to get the default which is 30 seconds, otherwise enter a value greater than 0.\nin_auto_config (ENUM(''current'', ''medium'', ''full''))\n  Automatically enable Performance Schema instruments and consumers.\n  NOTE: The more that are enabled, the more impact on the performance.\n  Supported values are:\n     * current - use the current settings.\n     * medium - enable some settings. This requires the SUPER privilege.\n     * full - enables all settings. This will have a big impact on the\n              performance - be careful using this option. This requires\n              the SUPER privilege.\n  If another setting the ''current'' is chosen, the current settings\n  are restored at the end of the procedure.\n\n\nConfiguration Options\n----------------------\n\nsys.diagnostics.allow_i_s_tables\n  Specifies whether it is allowed to do table scan queries on information_schema.TABLES. This can be expensive if there\n  are many tables. Set to ''ON'' to allow, ''OFF'' to not allow.\n  Default is ''OFF''.\n\nsys.diagnostics.include_raw\n  Set to ''ON'' to include the raw data (e.g. the original output of "SELECT * FROM sys.metrics").\n  Use this to get the initial values of the various views.\n  Default is ''OFF''.\n\nsys.statement_truncate_len\n  How much of queries in the process list output to include.\n  Default is 64.\n\nsys.debug\n  Whether to provide debugging output.\n  Default is ''OFF''. Set to ''ON'' to include.\n\n\nExample\n--------\n\nTo create a report and append it to the file diag.out:\n\nmysql> TEE diag.out;\nmysql> CALL sys.diagnostics(120, 30, ''current'');\n...\nmysql> NOTEE;\n'

    COMMENT '\nDescription\n-----------\n\nTraces all instrumentation within Performance Schema for a specific\nStatement Digest.\n\nWhen finding a statement of interest within the\nperformance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest table, feed\nthe DIGEST value in to this procedure, set how long to poll for,\nand at what interval to poll, and it will generate a report of all\nstatistics tracked within Performance Schema for that digest for the\ninterval.\n\nIt will also attempt to generate an EXPLAIN for the longest running\nexample of the digest during the interval. Note this may fail, as:\n\n   * Performance Schema truncates long SQL_TEXT values (and hence the\n     EXPLAIN will fail due to parse errors)\n   * the default schema is sys (so tables that are not fully qualified\n     in the query may not be found)\n   * some queries such as SHOW are not supported in EXPLAIN.\n\nWhen the EXPLAIN fails, the error will be ignored and no EXPLAIN\noutput generated.\n\nRequires the SUPER privilege for "SET sql_log_bin = 0;".\n\nParameters\n-----------\n\nin_digest (VARCHAR(64)):\n  The statement digest identifier you would like to analyze\nin_runtime (INT):\n  The number of seconds to run analysis for\nin_interval (DECIMAL(2,2)):\n  The interval (in seconds, may be fractional) at which to try\n  and take snapshots\nin_start_fresh (BOOLEAN):\n  Whether to TRUNCATE the events_statements_history_long and\n  events_stages_history_long tables before starting\nin_auto_enable (BOOLEAN):\n  Whether to automatically turn on required consumers\n\nExample\n-----------\n\nmysql> call ps_trace_statement_digest(''891ec6860f98ba46d89dd20b0c03652c'', 10, 0.1, true, true);\n+--------------------+\n| SUMMARY STATISTICS |\n+--------------------+\n| SUMMARY STATISTICS |\n+--------------------+\n1 row in set (9.11 sec)\n\n+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------------+------------+------------+\n| executions | exec_time | lock_time | rows_sent | rows_examined | tmp_tables | full_scans |\n+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------------+------------+------------+\n|         21 | 4.11 ms   | 2.00 ms   |         0 |            21 |          0 |          0 |\n+------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------------+------------+------------+\n1 row in set (9.11 sec)\n\n+------------------------------------------+-------+-----------+\n| event_name                               | count | latency   |\n+------------------------------------------+-------+-----------+\n| stage/sql/checking query cache for query |    16 | 724.37 us |\n| stage/sql/statistics                     |    16 | 546.92 us |\n| stage/sql/freeing items                  |    18 | 520.11 us |\n| stage/sql/init                           |    51 | 466.80 us |\n...\n| stage/sql/cleaning up                    |    18 | 11.92 us  |\n| stage/sql/executing                      |    16 | 6.95 us   |\n+------------------------------------------+-------+-----------+\n17 rows in set (9.12 sec)\n\n+---------------------------+\n| LONGEST RUNNING STATEMENT |\n+---------------------------+\n| LONGEST RUNNING STATEMENT |\n+---------------------------+\n1 row in set (9.16 sec)\n\n+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------------+------------+-----------+\n| thread_id | exec_time | lock_time | rows_sent | rows_examined | tmp_tables | full_scan |\n+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------------+------------+-----------+\n|    166646 | 618.43 us | 1.00 ms   |         0 |             1 |          0 |         0 |\n+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------------+------------+-----------+\n1 row in set (9.16 sec)\n\n// Truncated for clarity...\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| sql_text                                                        |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\n| select hibeventhe0_.id as id1382_, hibeventhe0_.createdTime ... |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (9.17 sec)\n\n+------------------------------------------+-----------+\n| event_name                               | latency   |\n+------------------------------------------+-----------+\n| stage/sql/init                           | 8.61 us   |\n| stage/sql/Waiting for query cache lock   | 453.23 us |\n| stage/sql/init                           | 331.07 ns |\n| stage/sql/checking query cache for query | 43.04 us  |\n...\n| stage/sql/freeing items                  | 30.46 us  |\n| stage/sql/cleaning up                    | 662.13 ns |\n+------------------------------------------+-----------+\n18 rows in set (9.23 sec)\n\n+----+-------------+--------------+-------+---------------+-----------+---------+-------------+------+-------+\n| id | select_type | table        | type  | possible_keys | key       | key_len | ref         | rows | Extra |\n+----+-------------+--------------+-------+---------------+-----------+---------+-------------+------+-------+\n|  1 | SIMPLE      | hibeventhe0_ | const | fixedTime     | fixedTime | 775     | const,const |    1 | NULL  |\n+----+-------------+--------------+-------+---------------+-----------+---------+-------------+------+-------+\n1 row in set (9.27 sec)\n\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (9.28 sec)\n'

Supported actions are:\n    * snapshot      Store a snapshot. The default is to make a snapshot of the current content of\n                    performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest, but by setting in_table\n                    this can be overwritten to copy the content of the specified table.\n                    The snapshot is stored in the sys.tmp_digests temporary table.\n    * overall       Generate analyzis based on the content specified by in_table. For the overall analyzis,\n                    in_table can be NOW() to use a fresh snapshot. This will overwrite an existing snapshot.\n                    Use NULL for in_table to use the existing snapshot. If in_table IS NULL and no snapshot\n                    exists, a new will be created.\n                    See also in_views and @sys.statement_performance_analyzer.limit.\n    * delta         Generate a delta analysis. The delta will be calculated between the reference table in\n                    in_table and the snapshot. An existing snapshot must exist.\n                    The action uses the sys.tmp_digests_delta temporary table.\n                    See also in_views and @sys.statement_performance_analyzer.limit.\n    * create_table  Create a regular table suitable for storing the snapshot for later use, e.g. for\n                    calculating deltas.\n    * create_tmp    Create a temporary table suitable for storing the snapshot for later use, e.g. for\n                    calculating deltas.\n    * save          Save the snapshot in the table specified by in_table. The table must exists and have\n                    the correct structure.\n                    If no snapshot exists, a new is created.\n    * cleanup       Remove the temporary tables used for the snapshot and delta.\n\nin_table (VARCHAR(129)):\n  The table argument used for some actions. Use the format ''db1.t1'' or ''t1'' without using any backticks (`)\n  for quoting. Periods (.) are not supported in the database and table names.\n\n  The meaning of the table for each action supporting the argument is:\n\n    * snapshot      The snapshot is created based on the specified table. Set to NULL or NOW() to use\n                    the current content of performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest.\n    * overall       The table with the content to create the overall analyzis for. The following values\n                    can be used:\n                      - A table name - use the content of that table.\n                      - NOW()        - create a fresh snapshot and overwrite the existing snapshot.\n                      - NULL         - use the last stored snapshot.\n    * delta         The table name is mandatory and specified the reference view to compare the currently\n                    stored snapshot against. If no snapshot exists, a new will be created.\n    * create_table  The name of the regular table to create.\n    * create_tmp    The name of the temporary table to create.\n    * save          The name of the table to save the currently stored snapshot into.\n\nin_views (SET (''with_runtimes_in_95th_percentile'', ''analysis'', ''with_errors_or_warnings'',\n               ''with_full_table_scans'', ''with_sorting'', ''with_temp_tables'', ''custom''))\n  Which views to include:\n\n    * with_runtimes_in_95th_percentile  Based on the sys.statements_with_runtimes_in_95th_percentile view\n    * analysis                          Based on the sys.statement_analysis view\n    * with_errors_or_warnings           Based on the sys.statements_with_errors_or_warnings view\n    * with_full_table_scans             Based on the sys.statements_with_full_table_scans view\n    * with_sorting                      Based on the sys.statements_with_sorting view\n    * with_temp_tables                  Based on the sys.statements_with_temp_tables view\n    * custom                            Use a custom view. This view must be specified in @sys.statement_performance_analyzer.view to an existing view or a query\n\nDefault is to include all except ''custom''.\n\n\nConfiguration Options\n----------------------\n\nsys.statement_performance_analyzer.limit\n  The maximum number of rows to include for the views that does not have a built-in limit (e.g. the 95th percentile view).\n  If not set the limit is 100.\n\nsys.statement_performance_analyzer.view\n  Used together with the ''custom'' view. If the value contains a space, it is considered a query, otherwise it must be\n  an existing view querying the performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest table. There cannot be any limit\n  clause including in the query or view definition if @sys.statement_performance_analyzer.limit > 0.\n  If specifying a view, use the same format as for in_table.\n\nsys.debug\n  Whether to provide debugging output.\n  Default is ''OFF''. Set to ''ON'' to include.\n\n\nExample\n--------\n\nTo create a report with the queries in the 95th percentile since last truncate of performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest\nand the delta for a 1 minute period:\n\n   1.

Rackham.\r\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.','','news','1',NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,'2024-07-18 16:08:55','iblock','S1',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'=ID=1&EXTERNAL_ID=&IBLOCK_TYPE_ID=news&IBLOCK_ID=1&IBLOCK_CODE=&IBLOCK_EXTERNAL_ID=&CODE=','Company','',NULL,'news','1',NULL,NULL,NULL),(5,'2024-07-18 16:09:59','iblock','S2',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'=ID=2&EXTERNAL_ID=&IBLOCK_TYPE_ID=news&IBLOCK_ID=1&IBLOCK_CODE=&IBLOCK_EXTERNAL_ID=&CODE=','World','',NULL,'news','1',NULL,NULL,NULL);
